## Introduction

Variables allow you to **store data in memory** so your program can use and update it later.

In JavaScript, variables are declared using:

- `var` (old, avoid)
- `let` (modern, mutable)
- `const` (modern, immutable reference)

> 💡 **Best practice:**  
> Always use `const` by default.  
> Use `let` only when reassignment is required.

## Declaring variables

```js
let username = "Kyaw Soe";
const role = "Full-Stack Developer";
```
